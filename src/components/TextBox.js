            Hii i am Uday i created this parallax website using react.js i started from java
            a backend programming language, 'this is a textbox' 
            between this parallax so you get to know a little about the creator so i was 
            talking about my journey in web development then i shifted towards node.js a javascript 
            server side runtime environment used as server side programming language and i worked on  databases with node.js and Rest api's
            and more then i started learning javascript's frontend libraries and framworks like
            react.js and next.js vue.js too but i didn't liked Vue.js for some reason so i sticked with react
            and react's frameworks its still a lot to learn and i am still learning thanks for reading!!
        </p>
    </div>

}

export default TextBox
