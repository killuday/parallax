        I wake up screaming in my sleep every fucking night
Open up my eyes to cold sweat, bloody clothes from my nose, ech
Nothing nice, Father I’ve killed a man, but I had to do it
Only thing is he is me, damn, how the fuck you couldn’t get me through this?!
My skin is bluish, voices in my head saying
Don’t be stupid all you have is in that bag you better use it!
Cut it, snuff it, puff it, shoot it,
only one I trust now is myself these muthafucka’s Judas
Gun in my pillow 'cause all I feel is this paranoia
Holes in my wall from all them nights that I was feeling for him
The devils here but I’m still awake, then I broke the mirror
Why? Cause I seen his face, even my bitch corrupted
I fucked her pussy until it's bloody
took it out and then she sucked it told me that she loved it, Bitch
Everything is black I think I am deceased
I am a ghost without the bed sheets, X speak
        </p>
    </div>
