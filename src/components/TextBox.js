            Hii i am uday i created this parallax website using react.js i started from java
            a backend programming language and then learned about databases, 'this is a textbox' 
            between this parallax so you can get to know a little bit about the creator so i was 
            talking about my journey in web development then i shifted towards node.js a javascript 
            server side language then i combined databases with node.js and then CRUD applications 
            and more then i shifted towards javascript and its frontend libraries and framworks like
            react.js and next.js vue.js too but i didn't liked it for some reason so i sticked with react
            and its frameworks its still alot to learning and i am still learning thanks!!
        </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default TextBox
